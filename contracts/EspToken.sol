/*
EspToken is a ERC20 compatible token with a initial supply and final supply.   
The token cannot be diluted with addtional minted supply after contract creation and can only be burned down to the final supply.
1% Tax is charged on each transaction
	Split 50/50 to a random account holder distribution and burn
	Once total supply is equal to final supply, the full 1% is randomly distributed to an account holder
Special Admin Functions (non-ERC20 additions)
	adminBurn - Allows admin to burn owner held tokens, used to execute buy back and burn policy
	adminTransfer - Admin can transfer tokens without incurring Tax & Burn
